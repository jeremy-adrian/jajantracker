    <p>We collect several types of information to ensure our service runs smoothly:</p>
    <ul>

            to upload a profile photo, we collect and store the image file you upload.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Device Information<br></strong> Device model, operating system, language settings, and unique

            processing.

        <li><strong>Location Data<br></strong> General location (e.g., country) inferred from IP address for compliance
            and ad targeting.
